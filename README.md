# Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict diseases based on symptoms using a Naive Bayes classifier. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify diseases given a set of symptoms.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of symptom data along with corresponding disease labels. It contains a total of X samples and Y features. There are Z classes representing different diseases.

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training
The Naive Bayes classifier is trained using the training dataset. The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is utilized for this task.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix metrics. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the classifier.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 100%. The confusion matrix visualization helps in understanding the classification performance for each disease.

## Graphical Analysis
Several visualizations, such as bar plots and heatmaps, are created to analyze the data and model performance visually.

## Conclusion
The Naive Bayes classifier demonstrates promising results in predicting diseases based on symptoms. Further optimization and fine-tuning could enhance the model's performance.

## Future Work
Future work may involve exploring additional machine learning algorithms, expanding the dataset with more samples, and improving the overall model architecture.
